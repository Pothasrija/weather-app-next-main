## Project Overview 
This weather application consists of two primary pages:

 * **Home Page**: Displays a list of cities, including their respective countries and time zones. Data is fetched from an external API to populate this list. Clicking on a city will redirect the user to the corresponding weather page.
 * **Weather Page**: Presents detailed weather information for the selected city. This page utilizes the city's latitude and longitude to retrieve weather data from an API. The displayed information includes:
   * Temperature (current, highest, and lowest)
   * Perceived temperature ("feels like")
   * Humidity
   * Wind speed
   * Weather condition (e.g., cloudy, sunny)
   
## Key Features

 * Unit Conversion: Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.
 * Location-Based Weather: The app allows users to input their current location to view accurate weather information for their specific area.
